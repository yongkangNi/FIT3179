        <h2>Choropleth visualisation in the world map</h2>
        <p>
          Within the choropleth shows that there is some country have
          higher death rate in the dark color like <strong>Mexico, china, Italy and
          Canada</strong>. There are three countries <strong>(italy,Mexico,Yemen)</strong>
          within over 1000 death in per 10,000 confirmed.

        <h2How is the impact of Covid-19 in different country and continent?</h2>
        <p>
          in the Bubble plot, it shows the relationship between
          the total population and confirmed cases in the different continents.
          The size is using the deaths per 10,000 confirmed. As we known that
          United states of America is suffering from the COVID-19 with lot of
          confirmed cases, but the deaths are controlled relatively in a
          standard amount.

      <div>
        <h2>The number of confirmed in each continent</h2>
        <p>
          in the bar char, the amount of confirmed in per 10000 population
          have the highest value which means that in this outbreak of virus that
          have a huge impact and the slower response in the virus protection in
          the Asia.
        </p>
        <p>
          in the Radial Plot, it illustrates that the amount of active,
          death, confirmed, Recovered in the different country.
